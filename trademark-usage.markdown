This Policy provides guidelines for use of the “Odis” name and logo (the “Odis Trademarks”) to identify the Odis software. Odis Foundation strives to be a steward of the Odis brand for the entire Odis Community and is the owner of the Odis Trademarks. As such, the law obligates us to police and protect the trademarks. Therefore, we require use of the Odis Trademarks to be in accordance with this policy.

Our goal is to ensure, on behalf of the Odis Community, that the Odis Trademark remain reliable indicators of quality and security while also permitting community members, software distributors and others to discuss Odis and to accurately describe their products’ affiliation with Odis or the Odis
Community, as well as exercise their rights given Odis’s open source nature. Note that this policy only applies to use of the Odis Trademarks.

## Overall Guidelines

You may use the “Odis” word mark to refer to the Odis software provided that your use is in compliance with this policy. Any other use of the Odis Trademarks, including any logos, requires prior written permission.

Overall, your use of the Odis Trademarks must not be confusing, misleading, false, or damaging to the Odis software, the Odis Community or to the Odis Trademarks themselves. 

People should always know who they are dealing with, and where the software they are downloading and using came from. You may not use the Odis Trademarks in any manner that implies approval or endorsement by, or association with, the Odis project or the Odis Community. When using the Odis Trademarks, your branding should be distinguishable from Odis trade dress.

You may not use the Odis Trademarks in a manner that may diminish or otherwise damage the goodwill in the Odis Trademarks. The “Odis” word mark should be used in its exact form, and not abbreviated or combined with any other word or words (e.g., “Odis” software rather than “Odis-ified”).

Your use of the Odis Trademarks does not transfer rights in the trademarks or goodwill to you.

## Uses that do not require permission

Provided your use complies with this policy, you may use the “Odis” word mark to accurately reference the Odis software, including on your website, in presentations and publications, at events, in advertising and marketing material, etc., for commercial and noncommercial purposes.

You may use the “Odis” word mark and any logos we placed on the software in connection with a redistribution of an official distribution of the Odis software that has not been modified or changed in any way.

Those taking full advantage of the open source nature of the Odis code may make modifications in accordance with the applicable open source license to create Derivative Works (as defined in the Apache License, version 2.0) of Odis. You may use the “Odis” word mark to refer to your Derivative Works of Odis provided (a) you include an additional identifier indicating you as the source of the Derivative Works (e.g., “Foocorp’s Odis Derivative”), (b) you clearly identify your modifications and indicate you are the source of the modifications, (c) your use does not suggest any affiliation between Odis or the Odis Community and you or your Derivative Works of Odis, and (d) your use of the “Odis” word mark should not be more prominent than your additional identifier.

Those taking advantage of the open source nature of the Odis code may also offer services for, or software that works with, Odis or Derivative Works of Odis, such as cloud management services. Users should not be confused as to the source of your software or services. With that in mind, you may use the “Odis” word mark to refer to services for, or software that works with, Odis or Derivative Works of Odis provided (a) you include an additional identifier indicating you as the source of the software or services (e.g., “Foocorp’s Odis Tool” or “Foocorp Odis Service”), (b) if your services or software works with Derivative Works of Odis, you clearly identify the modifications and indicate the source of the modifications, (c) your use does not suggest any affiliation between Odis or the Odis Community and you or your work, and (d) your use of the “Odis” mark should not be more prominent than your additional identifier.

You may also use the “Odis” word mark to make accurate statements about compatibility and interoperability using relational phrases such as “works with,” “runs on,” “compatible with,” and the like (e.g., “Foocorp Software powered by Odis” or “Foocorp Software for Odis” or “Foocorp Software with Odis compatibility”).

## Uses that require permission

* Use of the Odis logos in any way other than as expressly authorized by this Policy;
* Use as part of a domain name, except that you may use the Odis Trademarks in a subdomain name provided your use otherwise complies with this Policy (e.g., odis.foocorp.com);
* Use with non-software goods or services (e.g., physical products like devices or services that do not directly use the Odis software), except that you may use the Odis Trademarks with a limited number of swag or promotional items not for sale such as t-shirts, lanyards, or pens; and

## Trademark FAQ

2. **What can I do if I see abuse of the Odis Trademarks?** If you are aware of confusing or misleading use or other misuse of the Odis Trademarks, you may contact us as described above so we can investigate further.

3. **Can I use an Odis logo?** Coming soon! Our talented creative team is designing a logo for the Odis project and we can’t wait to share what they come up with. We will update these guidelines to include the logo and guidance on how you can use it.

4. **This Policy requires modifications and their source to be identified for Derivative Works of Odis, where should I put this information?** You may put this information in any location that is commonly used to convey differences from an upstream open source project, such as a NOTICE text or end-user documentation.
