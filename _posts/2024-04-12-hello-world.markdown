Welcome!
For the inaugural blog post on valkey.io, I’d like to recap the story so far, what to look forward to, and then describe how this blog works.

## How do you describe an open source whirlwind?

This is how I would describe it: first a license change, the establishment of PlaceholderKV, a new name and formation of Valkey within the Linux Foundation, hundreds of commits by community members from around the world, and a release candidate.
All within the span of about three weeks.

## Only the start

Out of this initial flurry of activity emerges a project that is sure to have a long history.
This blog will cover the project over time by describing what’s new, what to look forward to, and how you can explore the full extent of Valkey.

## For the community; with the community

Like the Valkey project itself, this blog is not a singular effort of one company but rather a community effort, built in the open with full transparency.
You want to write about a topic on the blog? That’s a pull request.
You want to help edit or review a post? Do a code review.
Problem with a post? Create an issue.
Feel like something is missing? Make a feature request.

## What’s next?

Stay tuned for trip reports from Valkey’s first conferences then information about first the GA release.
It’s only going to get more exciting from here.
